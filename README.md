# Limelight

Limelight is a native mobile app I developed in late 2020. The goal of the app is to be a sort of one-stop shop for all sharing, logging, and tracking of media.

This was my first big project using JavaScript and React Native. The app uses a Firestore database and works with multi-level CRUD to create lists within lists so that users can track different types of films.
